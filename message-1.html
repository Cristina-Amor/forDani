    <h3>My Dearest, Daniela,</h3>
    <p>
        <br><br>Bebi, I saw this tiktok kaninang umaga while waiting for my service. It says “love, help me understand the quiet language of your soul, so I’ll know I’m loving you the way you long to be loved.”

        <br><br>“Let me trace your love language in quiet moments, so you’ll never need to ask if... love, there are moments when i find myself completely lost – not in you, but in the uncertainty of whether I’m doing enough, saying the right things, or making you feel what I truly mean. I don’t always understand your actions. I don’t always catch your tone. Sometimes, I misread your silences and think they’re distance when maybe they’re just your way of processing. I know I get it wrong. Not because I don’t care, but because I care so much that I start filling in the blanks with fears instead of facts. In all my years of studying, I’ve learned so much – history, science, literature, all the complicated rules that run the world. But no one ever taught me how to read someone’s soul. No one told me how to gently hold another person’s emotions, or how to navigate the quiet spaces where words fall short. I was never taught how to respond when someone needs love but doesn’t know how to ask for it. And so, please, teach me. Teach me how to understand you, how to show up for you in the ways that feel right to you, not just the ways i think are right. I want to know what you’re thinking when your words fall away. I want to know the meaning behind your smallest gestures, the onse that most people would overlook. Because nothing about you feels small to me, not your sighs, not your silences, not your sideways glances. I want to know what’s behind them all. When we’re togetherm and everything is quiet, I wonder if your heart feels at peace next to mine. I wonder if you feel held, even when I’m not touching you, or if it’s falling short, lost in translation. Sometimes, i’m afraid that you’re quietly aching, that you’re hoping I’ll notice something I’ve missed. And that terrifies me. Because the last thing I ever want is for you to feel unseen when I’m looking right at you. I know I’m still learning. I know I might make mistakes. But I promise, I’m willing. I’m willing to relearn what I thought I knew about love if it means i can meet you where you are. I’m willing to pay attention more, listen deeper, softern where I’ve been hard, speak more gently where I’ve been loud. I want to learn how to love you in your own language – the language of your soul, of your fears, of your hopes and your quiet dreams, so love, if you could teach me, i’ll learn, i’ll learn it all – the softest parts, the hidden meanings, the things you’re afraid to say out loud. I’ll carry it with me, memorize it like a favorite story, and speak it back to you in every way I can. I don’t just want to love you. I want to love you right. In a way that leaves no room for doubt. In a way that feels like home, even when the world is chaotic. Because at the end of the day, it’s you I choose. And I want you to feel that – deeply, truly, and always. “

        <br><br>Noong nabasa ko ‘to, yung mga luha ko, gustong gusto na tumulo. Kailangan ko lang pigilan ‘coz I don’t want to make a scene. I deeply resonate with this tiktok message, kuhang kuha nito yung nararamdaman ko at gusto kong sabihin sayo. To be honest, I am not good with words talaga kaya if you’ll notice, mas marami pa kong nasesend na tiktok videos kaysa texts ng mga gusto kong sabihin sayo. I know your tampo isn’t about my failure to react at your message. I know this is about how I always left you to sleep with a heavy heart and I am really sorry bebi kase ngayon ko lang napagtanto. Na, kaya pag minsan parang walang pagmamahal sa mga messages mo. Na, pag minsan you don’t react to my sweet messages. Akala ko, gusto mo lang na lagi kang nilalambing. And now I know na mali ako. Now, I understand that these actions are because I am not treating you the way you want to be treated – the way you want to be loved. Baby, I’m sorry I made you feel this way. Tapos ngayon, pinaabot ko pa ng buong araw.

        <br><br>I also want to be completely honest with you. At first, I thought you don’t need to know this kase we’re both just strangers talking on tiktok. I thought this would only last for a day or two pero look at us, halos two weeks narin tayong magkausap. Now, everytime you call me “Bea” naguguilty po ako. Bea is not my real name. Bea is a character from Netflix Series na Warrior Nun. Sya yung naging name ko po dito because mahal na mahal ko yung character na yan to the point na I’m still waiting for Season 3 kahit na it’s been two years since ni-cancel nila yung show, I am still hoping na babalik sila. Now, I think it’s the right time to say that my name is Cristina, most people call me Tina, and sa bahay naman they call me Dan. I’ve been wanting to tell you this simula noong medyo naging close na tayo kaso hindi po ako makahanap ng right timing para sabihin ‘to sayo. Araw-araw, bago kita makausap sa gabi, iniisip ko kung paano ko po ito sasabihin sayo. I’m afraid kasi na baka once na sabihin ko na yung totoo, hindi mo na ko ulit kausapin. But lately, I’ve realized na sana mas pinaaga ko nalang na sabihin ito kase ngayon, hindi ko na po alam kung tatanggapin mo parin ako. Kung matutuloy parin ba yung pangarap natin na makapag live-in just for a while. Yung makapag yakapan sa buong magdamag. Yung maipag luto kita ng adobo. Yung manood tayo together ng spongebob hanggang sa makatulog tayo. At yung mapakinggan ko ang boses mo, ang mga tawa mo, and how I would look at you while listening to all the words that you will say, mapa may kwenta man o wala.

        <br><br>Ang dami ko na pong kasalanan sayo, I am genuinely sorry for all of this. Kung tatanggapin mo parin po ako, I promise I would do better, I would understand you better. I promise not to let you sleep with a heavy heart. But please, help me too. Let me trace your love language in quiet moments so you’ll never need to ask and translate yourself for me. I want to love you right. In a way that leaves no room for doubt. In a way that feels like home, even when the world is chaotic.
